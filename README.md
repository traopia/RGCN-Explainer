# RGCN-Explainer
The idea is to extend GNNExplainer for relational graphs. 
- In the Explain-ordered.ipynb - I am trying to understand step by step what the authors of [GNN Explainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894) did.

- In cora_chk I stored the: Cora trained model, Cora prediction (made by the saved trained model), and the adjacency matrix of the Cora dataset.
