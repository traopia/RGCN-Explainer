# RGCN-Explainer
The idea is to extend GNNExplainer for relational graphs. 
In the Explain.ipynb - I am trying to understand step by step what the authors of [GNN Explainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894) did.

Ok so Explain-ordered is clearly the version that should be more ordeered - getting messy on when it's about exploring the actual model - got some shape mismatches at the moment.
